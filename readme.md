# javascript map function 

- Javascript ES6 map function

- super helpful function

<hr>
The map function creates a new array populated from the results of the calling function. So when you call the map function on an array, it will loop through each item in that array & every single time it does that, it returns a value from the map function. You can choose to return a different value each time; for example. If we have an array of numbers & we want to double each number during every iteration, you can return the number that we're looping doubled; as a result & it will create a new array and return that to you.
